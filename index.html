                    <h3>Rape is often described as unwanted or forced 'sex' – or 'sex' that happened without consent. But, sex can only 
                        happen when everyone consents. Rape, on the other hand, is a form of sexual violence and a serious crime.</h3><br><br>

                    <h3>Rape and sexual assault</h3>
                    <p>All rape and sexual assault is serious. The terms rape and 'sexual assault' are used simply to differentiate between 
                    two types of offence. 
                    So what's the difference? <br><br>

                    The legal definition of rape is when a person intentionally penetrates another's vagina, anus or mouth with a penis, 
                    without the other person's consent. Assault by penetration is when a person penetrates another person's vagina or anus 
                    with any part of the body other than a penis, or by using an object, without the person's consent. <br><br>

                    The overall definition of sexual or indecent assault is an act of physical, psychological and emotional violation in the
                    form of a sexual act, inflicted on someone without their consent. It can involve forcing or manipulating someone to 
                    witness or participate in any sexual acts.<br><br>

                    Not all cases of sexual assault involve violence, cause physical injury or leave visible marks. Sexual assault can cause 
                    severe distress, emotional harm and injuries which can't be seen – all of which can take a long time to recover from. 
                    This is why we use the term 'assault', and treat reports just as seriously as those of violent, physical attacks.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Consent</h3>
                    <p> What separates sex, or a gesture of affection, from sexual assault? It's a matter of consent. That is, both people 
                    agreeing to what's happening by choice, and having the freedom and ability to make that choice. See 
                    <a href="http://www.consentiseverything.com/" target="_blank"><i>Consent is Everything</i></a> more advice and information.<br><br>
                    
                    Consent is different for children. In Nepal, the age of consent is 16 (the legal age when people can engage in sexual 
                    activity). The law is there to protect children from abuse or exploitation, rather than to prosecute under-16s who take part in sexual 
                    activity that everyone has agreed to.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Children aged under 16</h3>
                    <p>The Age of Consent in Nepal is 16 years old. The age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is 
                    considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 15 or younger in Nepal 
                    are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape or the 
                    equivalent local law.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Statutory Rape Law</h3>
                    <p>Nepal statutory rape law is violated when an individual has consensual sexual contact with a person under age 16. 
                    This law is applicable to both heterosexual couples, and homosexual men. There is no age of consent for homosexual women.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Young adults aged between 16-18</h3>
                    <p>The law gives extra protection to young people who are over the age of consent, but under 18.<br><br>

                    You can find out more about the age of consent on the
                    <a href="https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/nepal#:~:text=The%20Age%20of%20Consent%20in,to%20participation%20in%20sexual%20activity." target="_blank">

                    <h3>Common myths about rape</h3>
                    <p>It's widely thought that in most cases of rape, the offender is a stranger. The truth is the majority of people who 
                    commit rape know their victims and, in some cases, are relatives, friends or work colleagues.<br><br>

                    Rape within marriage and relationships can also occur. Remember, sex is about consent. If your partner has forced you 
                    into having sex with them, this is rape. We treat this as seriously as any other rape or sexual assault.<br><br>

                    <blockquote><h1>You are not to blame</h1></blockquote>
                    <p>Everyone responds differently to rape and sexual assault so whatever someone feels is a valid response. But, for lots 
                    of people, it can have a long-lasting impact on their feelings and wellbeing. 

                    Sometimes people are afraid to speak to their closed ones or the police because they were voluntarily taking drugs or 
                    drinking alcohol before the offence happened. Sometimes they have little or no recollection of what has happened. They 
                    may have a criminal record, and worry that the authorities won't treat them fairly. They might be worried that no one will believe them.<br><br>

                    Remember, no matter who you are, how long ago the assault happened or what took place, our prime concern is to give you 
                    the support you need. We'll listen, understand and guide you through the process at a pace you're comfortable with, 
                    whilst respecting your wishes.<br><br>
                    </p>
